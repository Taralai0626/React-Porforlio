   "content": "This Project is the first website that I created with some animations. The idea was inspired by the back photo I took a couple of years ago at Woodbine beach. I wanted the theme to be dreamy to match the background with more bubbles, which was why I decided to use a cannabis store to match it. When you click the \"Make some bubbles\" button, the bubble will start shooting. And when you hover over the bubble, it will pop. This was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.",
