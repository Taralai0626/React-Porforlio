Throughout the years, I noticed myself loving to solve problems around me academically. I was also inspired by some friends of mine that are professionals in programming and blockchain. I decided to start this path this year as well. Among other programming fields, I thought web development was the best choice since I am also interested in designing. My love for problem-solving and my interest in art and design make me a well-rounded and devoted Web Developer.",
